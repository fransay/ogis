# Introduction to GIS
- What is GIS ?  
GIS basically stands for Geographic(al) Information Systems is a computer based system for collecting, storing, managing, analyzing 
and visualizing geographic data.  
* In GIS, we solve the problem of `WHERE`. Understanding where points are positioned on the surface of the earth.
* GIS is usually made of layers of feature classes, usually with a spatial component attached.

- Understanding Layers in GIS  
A layer is a fundamental building block representing a collection of geographically referenced data, often organised by a theme or type of information.

- Understanding Data Types in GIS  
There are 2 primary data types namely
* Vector Data : Represent features as points,lines and polygons storing their coordinates.
* Raster Data: Represent geographic features as a grid of cells, where each cell has a value.
